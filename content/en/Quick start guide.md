To use Ritchie, you must follow these **3 steps**:

1. Installation
2. Initialization
3. Running a test formula

### **1. Installation**

First you have to install Ritchie according to your operating system. Check out more in the [**Getting Started section**](/docs-ritchie/getting-started/)

### **2. Initialization**

Once you finished Ritchie's installation, it is necessary to initialize it. To do so,  see more information on the [**Initialize CLI page**](/docs-ritchie/getting-started/).

### **3. Running a test formula**

Last \(but not least\), run a [**"hello-world"**](/docs-ritchie/formulas/hello-world-formula/) on Ritchie to confirm if your installation went well. Check out more on [**Formulas section**](/docs-ritchie/formulas/)
