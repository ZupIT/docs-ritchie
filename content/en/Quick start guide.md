To use Ritchie, you must follow these **3 steps**:

1. Installation
2. Initialization
3. Running a test formula

### **1. Installation**

First you have to install Ritchie according to your operating system. Check out more in the [**Getting Started section**]({{< ref path="Getting started" >}}).

### **2. Initialization**

Once you finished Ritchie's installation, it is necessary to initialize it. To do so, see more information on the [**Initialize CLI page**]({{< ref path="Getting started/Initialize cli" >}}).

### **3. Running a test formula**

Last, run a [**"hello-world"**]({{< ref path="Formulas/Hello world formula" >}}) on Ritchie to confirm if your installation went well. Check out more on [**Formulas section**]({{< ref path="Formulas" >}}).
