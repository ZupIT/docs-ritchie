## **How does Ritchie work?

In Ritchie's context, everything works trhough **formulas**!

It means that **a formula is a script** that can be executed automatically or interactively through a command line.

Adapting an existing script to Ritchie structure allows you to run it **locally** or through **Docker**, and to share it on **Bitbucket** ,**Github** or **Gitlab** repository.
