In general, the common process for executing a project is to create a whole previous infrastructure, defining a language in the system that will be programmed, downloading dependencies and defining the rules that should be used for the project.

**With Ritchie**, it's possible to define this configuration using a formula, creating this infrastructure directly by a command line, which in this case will delivered all the structure of the project with all files automatically configured. That helps on avoiding an important time spent on infrastructure and configurations.
