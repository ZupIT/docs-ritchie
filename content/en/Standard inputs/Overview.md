Informing inputs through **arguments** or **flags** allows the user to automate workflows. It is particularly useful when you're manipulating other tools within a script, as you can automate operations without having to interact with the terminal.

Basically, there are two ways to inform input parameters directly on the command lines:

1. Through the STDIN flag . _**(will be deprecated in early 2021)**_
2. Through Input flags.

You can check out more about each of them on the following pages:
