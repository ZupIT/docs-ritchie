## What is the difference between workspace and repository? 

Repositories and workspaces are both used to interact with formulas on Ritchie in different ways, check out the difference:

**`workspace`** You can use workspace commands to code, develop, edit and test formulas.

**`repository`** You can use repository commands to download formulas and consume them.

Commands for repos and workspaces are similar, both will allow the CLI to "see" available formulas. Workspaces have a higher priority than Repos (if you use both commands for the same formulas repositories, the workspaces formulas will be executed).

Check out more about workspace and repositories commands [**in the list of commands and flags**](/docs-ritchie/reference/list-of-commands-and-flags/).
