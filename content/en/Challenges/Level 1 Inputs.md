# Level 1: Inputs

## Objective

On this tutorial, the idea is to teach you how to create a formula on Ritchie that will **sum two positive numbers**.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Command suggestion: **`rit math sum numbers`**
{{% /alert %}}

## Inputs

This formula needs to contain \(at least\) those two inputs parameters, see below:

1. Number one \(`RIT_NUMBER_ONE`\). 
2. Number two \(`RIT_NUMBER_TWO`\).

## Step by step

The formula needs to follow the next steps:

1. Extract all inputs parameters. 
2. Convert inputs to integers \(there is currently no _**integer**_ `type` in inputs config.json file\). 
3. Sum both numbers. 
4. Return the result on the terminal.

{{% alert color="success" %}}
Well done! You've completed the first task! 
{{% /alert %}}

## Improvement suggestions

 If you want to play a little more, here are some suggestions:

* Add a validation of the input parameters to return an error to the user if the parameter is not an integer. 
* Allow the user to sum negative numbers with positive ones. 
* Allow the user to digit decimals in addition to integers.

## **Next steps**
