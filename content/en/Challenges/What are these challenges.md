description: >-
  In this section, you will find challenging tasks to start implementing simple
  formulas on Ritchie with a gradual complexity.
---


## Context 

The objective of this section is to help users to understand step by step several activities  you are able to do with Richie.

### Premises

To perform the tasks in this section, it will be necessary to understand the following concepts:

1. [**How to run formulas**](/docs-ritchie/tutorials/formulas/how-to-run-formulas/)
2. [**How to create formulas**](/docs-ritchie/tutorials/formulas/how-to-create-formulas/)
3. [**How to implement formulas**](/docs-ritchie/tutorials/formulas/how-to-implement-formulas/)
4. [**How to build formulas**](/docs-ritchie/tutorials/formulas/how-to-build-formulas/)
5. [**How to group formulas**](/docs-ritchie/tutorials/formulas/how-to-group-formulas/)

### Challenges 

The **`first challenge`** is to understand how to manipulate basic inputs.



The **`second challenge`** is to understand how to manipulate credentials inputs.



The **`third challenge`** is to understand how to manipulate conditional inputs.



The **`fourth challenge`** is to apply the formula aggregation concept.
