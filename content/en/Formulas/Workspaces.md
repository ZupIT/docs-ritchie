## What is the difference between workspace and repository?

Repositories and workspaces are both used to interact with formulas on Ritchie in different ways, check out the difference:

**`workspace`** You can use workspace commands to develop, edit and test formulas `locally`.

**`repository`** You can use repository commands to import formulas from `git repositories` and execute them.

*There is an example to add a repository on the [**Hello World Formula**](/docs-ritchie/formulas/hello-world-formula/) section.*

Commands for repos and workspaces are similar, both will allow the CLI to "see" available formulas on the local machine. Workspaces have a **higher priority** than Repos (if you use both commands for the same formulas repositories, the workspaces formulas will be executed).

Check out more about workspace and repositories commands [**in the list of commands and flags**](/docs-ritchie/reference/list-of-commands-and-flags/).

## How to Add?

You can add any

To add a workspace, you just have to run this command:

```text
rit add workspace
```

Once you've made this, follow the steps:

**Step 1:** Inform the workspace name (don't use *spaces* or *special characters*).

**Step 2:** Inform the workspace path on the local machine.

## How to List?

To list avalaible workspaces, you just have to run this command:

```text
rit list workspace
```

## How to Update?

If you're not the only person updating the workspace (e.g: if it's a cloned repository from git) you may need to update the workspace to allow the CLI to "see" new available formulas or updates on the local machine after *pulling* the code.

To update a workspace, you just have to run this command:

```text
rit update workspace
```

Once you've made this, select the workspace name and wait for the CLI output message.

## How to Delete?

To delete a workspace, you just have to run this command:

```text
rit delete workspace
```

Once you've made this, follow the steps:

**Step 1:** Select the workspace name.

**Step 2:** Confirm you want to delete the workspace.
